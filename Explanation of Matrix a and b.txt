1. Matrix a is the IDL output of one quantum dot at the upper focus plane 1
2. Matrix b is the IDL output of the same quantum dot at the lower focus plane 2
3. Sample excel file of IDL output is provided under this link named as"Sample excel file of Matrix a" and "Sample excel file of Matrix b"
4. Excel file contains 6 columns, row number is frame number which is related to time (s), time=row number * 0.1 (s)
5. Column definiton of 6 columns:
     column 1: peak intensity
     column 2: x position standard deviation from gaussian fitting
     column 3: y position standard deviation from gaussian fitting
     column 4: x position from 2D gaussian fitting of single quantum dot intensity
     column 5: y position from 2D gaussian fitting of single quantum dot intensity
     column 6: One dimensional projection to the moving path from the first position to the last position (this column is not needed for calculation of x,y,z position)

6. Sample Matrix a and b is from data on 2019/07/03, which can be tested for MATLAB function code "Quantum_Dot_3D_analysis_20190702"
7. t in the function is the frame number of fusion time point
7. Fusion time of this sample excel file is 70.9 s which means the frame number (t) is 709
